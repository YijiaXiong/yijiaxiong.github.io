## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

* Took part in the development of an ultrafast time-resolved fluorescence depletion system. Studied the ultrafast vibrational relaxation and the solvation effect of some fluorescent dyes.  
* Studied the ionization of molecules under strong field created by femtosecond laser. Built the experimental setup which included an amplified femtosecond laser system and a home-built time of flight mass spectrometer. Wrote the program for the experimental system with C++.
* Developed a theoretical model of tunneling ionization to analyze the strong field ionization data. Extended the transfer matrix method to calculate the tunneling ionization probability of molecules. Proposed and implemented the algorithm in C++ language.
* Built a confocal far-field single molecule fluorescence microscope system for measurements of protein dynamics.
* Developed cell permeable reagents permitting validation of protein-protein interactions within living cells. Multiple bi-Arsenical dyes, including AsCy3, AsCy5, AsCy3 ester and AsCy3Cy5, have been developed which were directed to different small binding motif build into proteins. The discovery of Cy3-based biarsenical fluorescent probe AsCy3 was highlighted by Nature (Game of tag, Vol 448, Page 4, 2007).
* Developed biochemical applications and methods for these dyes, including in vivo protein labeling and imaging, membrane protein turn-over and super-resolution imaging.
* Created capability for the purification and functional assay of anaerobic proteins (i.e., hydrogenases and nitrogenases) as part of a multi-disciplinary Basic Energy Sciences (BES) project supported by the Department of Energy.
* Maintained microscopy facility and created capabilities for high-throughput assays of protein binding affinities and function. Developed the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy system and used it to study the high-affinity binding and direct electron transfer from a bacteria's (Shewanella oneidensis MR-1) outer membrane protein OmcA to a mineral form of iron oxide. It was the first report of direct electron transfer from protein to solid metal oxide. The result indicated the potential application of the purified protein in the construction of a biofuel cell and has been cited more than 150 times.
* Instrumentation design lead responsible for development and maintenance of core capabilities associated with molecular biology, protein purification, and instrumentation.  Includes staff training and assistance in applications involving biomaterial assembly, protein stabilization, and development of diagnostic applications linked to pathogen detection.
* Team lead in development of industrial collaborations involving creation of RNA capture technology for array detection of cancer biomarkers.  
* Team lead in developing capability to identify structural correlations between FT-IR and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) data to identify biomarkers linked to Gorlin syndrome.
* Identified structure/function relationships associated with membrane protein function and the regulation of protein degradation by the proteasome.  
* Took part in the study of biofilm. Applied multivariant analysis and machine learning algorithm on Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) data and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy data. For TOF-SIMS data, image reconstruction was also involved. The program languages used included Matlab, R and python.
