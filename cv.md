## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Research Assistant Professor at Western University of Health Sciences (Lebanon, OR)
* Instrumentation design lead responsible for development and maintenance of core capabilities associated with molecular biology, protein purification, and instrumentation.  Includes staff training and assistance in applications involving biomaterial assembly, protein stabilization, and development of diagnostic applications linked to pathogen detection.
* Team lead in development of industrial collaborations involving creation of RNA capture technology for array detection of cancer biomarkers.  
* Collaborated with an industrial company (Gene Tools, LLC) in creating morpholino-based RNA capture technology for the detection of pathogen and cancer biomarkers. A lateral flow assay has been developed. A few prototypes based on laser-induced fluorescence detection have been built and tested as well. The [photos of the prototypes](https://yijiaxiong.github.io/lif) are in the research gallery . 
* Investigated protein stabilization in confined biomaterials, including protein-based hydrogel and engineered diatoms biosilica matrix.

### Research Scientist, Battelle (Richland, WA)
* Pioneered microscopy system for single molecule detection and super-resolution imaging.
* Developed cell permeable reagents permitting validation of protein-protein interactions within living cells. Multiple bi-Arsenical dyes, including AsCy3, AsCy5, AsCy3 ester and AsCy3Cy5, have been developed which were directed to different small binding motif build into proteins. The discovery of Cy3-based biarsenical fluorescent probe AsCy3 was highlighted by Nature (Game of tag, Vol 448, Page 4, 2007). Here is the [link to the paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja070003c). [AsCy3Cy5 enables super-resolution imaging](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja308503x).
* Developed biochemical applications and methods for these dyes, including in vivo protein labeling and imaging, membrane protein turn-over and super-resolution imaging.
* Developed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) for high-throughput protein binding affinity and function assays, utilizing the Inverse Laplace Transform method for size distribution resolution. Some results are shown [here.](fcs)
* Created instrumental and computational tools for high-throughput identification of protein functional changes and protein-protein interaction networks within living cells.
* Applied machine learning and deep learning algorithms to advance chemical imaging analysis in Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, as well as time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). Here showcases the [Data Analysis Software for Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS)](imgPCA).
* Established protocols for purification and functional assay of anaerobic proteins in support of a multi-disciplinary Basic Energy Sciences (BES) project funded by the Department of Energy.
* Managed instrument operation and maintenance as the cognizant space manager in the Biological Science Facility. 

### Postdoctoral Fellow, Dept. of Biomolecular Sciences, Univ. of Kansas (Lawrence, KS)	
* Developed a confocal far-field single-molecule fluorescence microscope system for protein dynamics measurements.
* Conducted chemical kinetics simulations to identify structure/function relationships associated with membrane protein function and regulation of protein degradation by the proteasome.  
* [Single Molecule Spectroscopy @ KU](sms)

### Doctoral Candidate, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academic of Science (Beijing, China)
* Took part in the development of an ultrafast time-resolved fluorescence depletion system. Studied the ultrafast vibrational relaxation and the solvation effect of some fluorescent dyes.  
* Built a time-of-flight mass spectrometer to study the tunneling ionization of molecules under the ultra-intense laser. Studied the ionization of molecules under strong field created by femtosecond laser. 
* Developed a theoretical model of tunneling ionization to analyze the strong field ionization data. Extended the transfer matrix method to calculate the tunneling ionization probability of molecules. 
* Implemented the matrix transfer algorithm for the calculation of tunneling ionization probability.
