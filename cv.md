## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
* Took part in the development of an ultrafast time-resolved fluorescence depletion system. Studied the ultrafast vibrational relaxation and the solvation effect of some fluorescent dyes.  
* Studied the ionization of molecules under strong field created by femtosecond laser. Built the experimental setup which included an amplified femtosecond laser system and a home-built time of flight mass spectrometer. Wrote the program for the experimental system with C++.
* Developed a theoretical model of tunneling ionization to analyze the strong field ionization data. Extended the transfer matrix method to calculate the tunneling ionization probability of molecules. Proposed and implemented the algorithm in C++ language.
* Built a confocal far-field single molecule fluorescence microscope with capabilities of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), confocal fluorescence imaging, and single molecule fluorescence burst analysis. This setup enabled the study of protein interactions at the single molecule level. The data acquisition program was written in VB6 and data analysis was written in VB, VC++ or vb.net. Advance data analysis was done with Matlab and R.
* Studied a novel approach of protein labeling with bi-Arsenical fluorescent dyes. Multiple bi-Arsenical dyes, including AsCy3, AsCy5, AsCy3 ester and AsCy3Cy5, have been developed which were directed to different small binding motif build into proteins. The discovery of Cy3-based biarsenical fluorescent probe AsCy3 was highlighted by Nature (Game of tag, Vol 448, Page 4, 2007).
* Developed biochemical applications and methods for these dyes, including in vivo protein labeling and imaging, membrane protein turn-over and super-resolution imaging.
* AsCy3Cy5 was specifically designed to facilitate stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) method for super-resolution imaging. A home-built microscope with EMCCD camera was used to acquire the images and the image reconstruction was done either by a home-written Matlab script or an ImageJ plugin.
* Using the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy method to study the high-affinity binding and direct electron transfer from a bacteria's (Shewanella oneidensis MR-1) outer membrane protein OmcA to a mineral form of iron oxide. It was the first report of direct electron transfer from protein to solid metal oxide. The result indicated the potential application of the purified protein in the construction of a biofuel cell and has been cited more than 150 times.
* Studied the dynamic stabilization of protein in biomaterials including engineered diatiom biosilica matrix or protein based hydrogel system. Model proteins included green fluorescence protein, single chain fragment antibody and adenylate kinase.  It is found both biosilica or hydrogel system improved the stability of proteins under tough conditions include 8M Urea or elevated temperature, while mass transfer was unrestricted and the protein maintained accessibility and flexibility. Thereby, those biomaterials enable potent application for the detection of a range of different molecules including pathogen and chemical or biological agents. 
* Took part in the study of biofilm. Applied multivariant analysis and machine learning algorithm on Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) data and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy data. For TOF-SIMS data, image reconstruction was also involved. The program languages used included Matlab, R and python.
