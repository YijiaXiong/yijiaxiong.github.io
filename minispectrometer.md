# 3D-Printed Mini-Spectrometer

Welcome to the showcase of my mini spectrometer. It was designed using Autodesk Fusion 360 and printed using an Ender3 3D printer. A 1000 line/mm plastic grating was used as the light dispersion parts. You can go to https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4868770 to download the stl files and make one for yourself if you have a 3D printer handy.

## Spectrometer Overview

## How It Works

1. The LED light source emits light, which passes through the collimating lens, transforming it into a parallel beam.
2. The parallel beam encounters the 1000 line/mm plastic grating, causing diffraction and splitting the light into its constituent colors.
3. The dispersed light is then focused by the chosen lens, generating a clear and distinct spectrum.
4. I use my smartphone's camera to capture the spectrum, enabling detailed analysis and comparison.

## Spectral Applications

My 3D-printed spectrometer has proven to be a versatile tool for various applications:

- **Element Identification:** By comparing the observed spectra with reference spectra, I can identify elements and compounds based on their characteristic emission or absorption lines.
- **Doppler Effect Exploration:** Analyzing the shifts in spectral lines caused by relative motion has enabled me to investigate celestial phenomena, such as the motion of stars and galaxies.

## Educational Value

Creating and using this spectrometer has been an enriching educational experience:

- **Hands-On Learning:** Constructing the spectrometer deepened my understanding of optics, diffraction, and light behavior.
- **Critical Thinking:** Troubleshooting and optimizing the setup honed my problem-solving skills and encouraged creative thinking.
- **Data Interpretation:** Analyzing captured spectra fostered my data analysis and interpretation abilities.

## Conclusion

My 3D-printed spectrometer exemplifies the fusion of technology, science, and creativity. It serves as a tangible representation of the fascinating world of spectroscopy and its applications. Through this project, I've not only gained insights into the intricate interactions between light and matter but also contributed to the ever-growing community of amateur scientists exploring the wonders of the universe.
