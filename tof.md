# Strong Field Ionization Time-of-Flight System
This system was built to study the strong field the ionization of molecules under strong field created by femtosecond laser. The system was based on a home-built time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
Here is the mass spectrometer:

The amplified femtosecond laser system was kept in a cleanroom.  Laser beam was provided through the windows (visualable in the picture).  Here is a view of the laser system in the cleanroom:

The control program was written in Borland C++ and run under DOS enviroment. Time-of-flight mass spectroscopy required a high speed data acquisition card which took over all the resource of the computer. So... sorry, no TSR program (terminate and stay resident program) and no screenshots 
is available for this system.
### Sample Result (from my thesis)
A few representive mass spectra of Acetonitrile under different strong-field caused by femtosecond laser.

The simulated result calculated by my program fit the experimental data very well.
