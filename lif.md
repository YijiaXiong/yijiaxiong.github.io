# Laser Induced Fluorescence(LIF) Detection System
This is part of my current project. Our long term goal is to develop a portable, point-of-care 
device for on-site pathagen detection. I have built a few Laser Induced Fluorescence(LIF) prototypes 
for this project. 
## Hardware
Here is a minimal setup for LIF. Notice the CPS1 battery pack - this system powered by rechargable 
battery which make it possible to be portable.

A more powerful system was also built. This system has multiple lasers installed on a manual wheel 
(left side) and an automatical filter wheel which can be controlled by the data acquisition program. 
A multiple channel relay circuit was include to control the power of the lasers.

Here is a close-up of the setup.

## Software
The system is still under development. Here is a screenshot of the primary software:
