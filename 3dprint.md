# 3D Printed Protein Structures

Here shows a test of the capability of printing protein structrues with my home-built hobby 3D printer.

I chose to print my favorite protein - Calmodulin. Calmodulin could bind to various target peptides, including the M13 peptide. The protein structures was rendered by Pymol:

My 3d printer accepts STL format model files but Pymol can not export STL files. So the structures were exported as VRML files and converted to STL files with Meshlab. Then they can be sent to the 3D printer for printing. Here is the lineup of the final printed structrues:

Not too bad!
