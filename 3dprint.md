# 3D Printed Protein Structures

Here shows a test of the capability of printing protein structrues with my home-built hobby 3D printer.

I chose to print my favorite protein - Calmodulin. Calmodulin could bind to various target peptides, including the M13 peptide. The protein structures was rendered by Pymol:

My 3d printer accepts STL format model files. So the structures were exported as VRML files and converted to STL files with Meshlab. Here is the lineup of the final printed structrues:

Not too bad!
